# CIDEr is a lightweight IDE for C/C++ programming

Feel free to contribute in this project.

#### Why a new C++ IDE ?
The simple answer is that I don't feel much satisfied by current C/C++ IDEs.
The good ones are paid ones.

#### GOALS
CIDEr has 3 main goals :
    1 : Be superfast and superlight for almost all platforms
    2 : Look good on almost all platforms
    3 : Provide as many features as possible.

#### FEATURES
    Just created the project so only one feature : A github repo.

#### TARGETS
Here I will write down targets. A target is a feature that is yet to be added.
    1 : Basic UI setup. (Ability to create new files, edit files and save files)
    2 : Font Settings.
    3 : Syntax highlighting for C/C++ programs.
